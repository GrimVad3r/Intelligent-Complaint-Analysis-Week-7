Specific complaints include problems making critical purchases due to credit card issues, frustration with the credit card application process, and an excessive number of problems encountered in a short period of time.

Additionally, there is a theme of feeling let down by the financial institution, leading some customers to consider discontinuing their use of credit cards altogether.
